Context
In Wind Turbines, Scada Systems measure and save data's like wind speed, wind direction, generated power etc. for 10 minutes intervals. 
This file was taken from a wind turbine's scada system that is working and generating power in Turkey.

Content
The data's in the file are:

Date/Time (for 10 minutes intervals)
LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment
Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation)
Theoretical_Power_Curve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer
Wind Direction (Â°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly)
